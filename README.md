### Project: Explore US Bikeshare Data

### Project Description
This Python project uses data provided by Motivate, a bike share system provider for many major cities in the United States, to uncover bike share usage patterns. It includes the system usage in three large cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington, DC.

The project will import US bike share data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. It creates an interactive experience to let user choose what data and what kind of statistics to present.

### Files used
**Code file:**
- bikeshare.py

**Data files:**
- chicago.csv
- new_york_city.csv
- washington.csv

Randomly selected data for the first six months of 2017 are provided for all three cities. All three of the data files contain the same core six (6) columns:
- Start Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:07:57)
- End Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:20:53)
- Trip Duration (in seconds - e.g., 776)
- Start Station (e.g., Broadway & Barry Ave)
- End Station (e.g., Sedgwick St & North Ave)
- User Type (Subscriber or Customer)

The Chicago and New York City files also have the following two columns:
- Gender
- Birth Year
